    <h1>Conway's game of life.</h1>
    <p>A p5.js implementation of conway's game of life.</p>
    <p>Conway's game of life is staged on a grid of cells. These cells each have 2 states, alive or dead. They can change state according to these three simple rules:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>If a dead cell has exactly three neighbors, it becomes an alive cell (Birth).</li>
        <li>If a live cell has more than 3 neighbors then it dies (Overpopulation).</li>
        <li>If a live cell has less than 2 neighbors then it dies (Isolation).</li>
    </ol>
